# Objective
Become the champion by taking all of your Badge Tokens.
# Preparation
To play Mt. Silver, 4 players come together, each providing a 43 card deck that represents that player's region. 
## Building Your Region
There are 4 components to your 43 card deck
- A Supporter card that represents the Pokémon Trainer you are playing as.
- A starting Pokémon card.
- A starting energy card.
- A 40 card region deck.
## Pokémon Trainer
This card can by any Supporter card. You will play as this Pokémon Trainer in the game. You will have the option of using this supporter's ability each turn, so choose carefully!
## Starting Pokémon and Starting Energy
These two cards will be part of your starting hand. The Pokémon must be a basic Pokémon without a rulebox. The energy can be any energy card (basic or special).
## Region Deck
This deck is built of 40 cards. It must be exactly 40 cards, no more, no less. The Pokémon Trainer, Starting Pokémon, and Starting Energy do not count towards the 40 cards. The only restriction is that no two cards can share the same set and card number. International cards are allowed, but they must fulfill the slots of the English cards sets.

>[!Example]- Reprints of Arven
You cannot have two copies of Arven SV1 166. However, you can include Arven SV1 166, Arven SV1 235, and Arven OBF 186.  

>[!Example]- International Cards
>The Japanese Arven SV4a 353 can be used, but it will take the slot of International Arven PAF 235.

# Setup
After all 4 players have constructed their decks, they come together to setup a game.
- Players take turns describing their deck, showing off the Pokémon, Trainers, and Energy the region provide.
- Players place their Pokémon Trainer on their play mat to the side.
- Players place their Starting Pokémon face up on their active slot on the play mat.
- Players hold their Starting Energy in their hand.
- Players place 6 Badge Tokens face down near their play space.
- Players shuffle their region deck and draw 6 cards to add to their hand
- All players take the remaining cards from the region deck and shuffle them all together into one deck.

>[!NOTE]- Different card sleeves are encouraged!
>It is possible that when using different card sleeves that players will be able to tell which cards from which region are next in the deck. This is encouraged! 

- After the deck is shuffled, draw 8 cards from the deck and place them face down near to the deck. Repeat this till there are 6 piles.
- These piles are the Area Piles of Mt. Silver.
- Players roll a die to see who goes first. The player who rolled highest goes first. In the event of a tie for highest, keep rolling until one player rolls higher. That player will go first.
- Each player reveals their starting Pokémon.
- Play begins with the first player.
# Play
The game plays with the current version of the standard Pokémon TCG rules with the following changes:
- Players cannot play supporters or attack until the last player's first turn.
- All players share the same discard pile.
- When cards mention your opponent's cards they refer to all opponents.
- A player can use their Pokémon Trainer's ability as their supporter card for the turn.
- Any mention of prize cards applies to the level piles.
- When a card references 'taken' prize cards applies to taken Badge Tokens.
- When a player Knocks Out a Pokémon, instead of taking prize cards that player takes one of their Badge Tokens by flipping it face up.
- When a player takes a Badge Token, that player may choose to explore one of the remaining Area Piles of Mt. Silver in a draft! 
	- The player who earned the Badge Token takes an Area Pile, looks at the cards, and selects one of the cards from the pile and places it in their hand.
	- The remaining cards are passed clockwise, with each player taking a card until no cards remain.
- When a player Knocks Out their own Pokémon, all opponents take one Badge Token.
- If a player has no Pokémon in play, they remain in the game.
- If only one player has any Pokémon in play, that player wins the game.
- Once all of a player's Badge Tokens are taken, that player becomes the Champion and the game ends.
- Once per turn you may reveal a Pokémon in your hand to trade with another player. All other players are given the opportunity to trade by revealing a Pokémon in their hand. The initiating player selects one of the options and those players exchange cards between hands.
- If the deck is empty and a player would draw another card, shuffle the discard pile and replace the deck, then continue drawing cards.

# Additional Rules
- Using your Pokémon Trainer's supporter ability counts as using it from your hand.
- When a Pokémon is Knocked Out from a special condition, consider the Knock Out to come from the player who caused the special condition.
- When a card says 'opponent', 'opponent's',  consider all opponents.
>[!example]- Teal Mask Ogerpon (TWM 024)
>
>**Ogre Comeback**
>This attack does 20 more damage for each of your opponent's Benched Pokémon.
>
>Resolution - Count the Benched Pokémon for each other player.

>[!example]- Counter Catcher (SIN 091)
>
>You can only play this card if you have more Prize cards remaining than your opponent.
>
>Resolution - If you have taken fewer Badge Tokens than *any* opponent, you can play this card.

- When a card says 'both', consider each player.
>[!example]- Annihilape (SSP 100)
>
>**Destined Fight**
>Both Active Pokémon are Knocked Out.
>
>Resolution - All Active Pokémon are Knocked Out. 

- When a card has a sequence for performing an effect, start with the indicated player and continue clockwise.
>[!example]- Sky Field (ROS 089)
>
>Each player can have 8 Pokémon on his or her Bench.
>*(When this card leaves play, each player discards Benched Pokémon until he or she has 5 Pokémon on the Bench. The owner of this card discards first.)*
>
>Resolution - Start with the owner discarding, then proceed to the player on the owner's left.

- When a card requires players drawing from their deck, start with the player who played the card.
>[!example]- Iono (PAL 185)
>
>Each player shuffles their hand and puts it on the bottom of their deck. If either player put any cards on the bottom of their deck in this way, each player draws a card for each of their remaining Prize cards.
>
>Resolution - The player who played this card puts their cards on the bottom first, then the player to their left. After all players have placed their cards on the bottom of the deck, the player who played this card draws first, then the player to their left.

# Tips
- Selecting a Pokémon Trainer to play as is a key component to creating a fun experience for your and your group! Consider encouraging or restricting the types of Supporter cards to select for your deck's Trainer.
>[!example]- Hand Disruption
>Selecting cards like Iono, Marnie, or N as your Pokémon trainer will allow that player to reset everyone's hand every turn. Some players may like the chaos of constantly changing options. Some players will want to select a trainer to counter that strategy. But some groups may find that this adds too much variance to the game and opt to limit those cards to their region deck, and not play as their Pokémon Trainer.

>[!example]- Drawing Cards
>Cards like Morty's Conviction, Honey, or Lass's Special can be very powerful Supporters to select as a Pokémon Trainer. When building a deck with this Trainer, consider putting many hand disruption options in your region deck such as Iono, Judge, or Kingdra (LOR 037).

- When building a region deck, consider putting the counter to your strategy in the deck. This can make it fun for any player who manages to pull off the combo to find a way to stop it. If other players manage to draw the cards for your deck's combo, you may find yourself searching for those counter cards!
>[!example]- Dark Moon
>Umbreon & Darkrai-GX (UNM 125) has a fun Dark Moon-GX attack which can knock out all of its opponent's Active Pokémon if it gathers enough Darkness energy! A great counter is Hoopa ex who can use that same Darkness energy to score a Knock Out before the attack goes off.
